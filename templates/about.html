            <h2>My Journey in Tech</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Faith Wanjiku Wanjira, a passionate Python developer with a love for 
                creating beautiful and functional web applications. My journey into programming 
                began with curiosity about how websites work, and it has grown into a full-blown 
                passion for building digital solutions that make a difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                I specialize in Python development using Flask framework, MySQL databases, and 
                modern frontend technologies. What excites me most about programming is the 
                endless possibility to create, innovate, and solve real-world problems through 
                code. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and push my 
                boundaries.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
                open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge with other aspiring developers. 
                I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and communities, and 
                I'm committed to being part of that positive change.
            </p>

            <h2>My Values & Approach</h2>
            <p>
                I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices. 
                Continuous learning is at the core of my approach - I'm always exploring new 
                technologies and methodologies to improve my skills. Collaboration and 
                knowledge-sharing are also important to me, as I believe we grow faster when 
                we grow together.
